\title{Detect and Summarize Drought Events from Droughts Index Time Series}
\usage{
droughts(df, vname, threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A \code{data.frame} or \code{tibble} containing the time series data.
Must include either:
\itemize{
\item a \code{date} column of class \code{Date} or \code{POSIXct}, or
\item separate \code{year} and \code{month} columns.
\item a numeric column specified by \code{vname} that contains the drought index values.
}}

\item{vname}{A string indicating the name of the numeric column to be evaluated (e.g., \code{"spei12"}).}

\item{threshold}{A numeric threshold below which values are considered part of a drought event.}
}
\value{
A named list with three elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{data}: the original data frame with drought flags and durations.
\item \code{drought_events}: only the rows that are part of drought events (duration â‰¥ 2).
\item \code{drought_assessment}: summary of each event, including duration, intensity, severity, and timing.
}
}
\description{
Identifies drought events in a time series when a given index (e.g., SPEI) falls below a specified threshold
for at least two consecutive months. Returns the processed dataset, the detected drought events,
and a summary of their characteristics.
}
\examples{
data(spei)
# Detect droughts in the SPEI-12 time series with a threshold of -1.28
droughts_result <- droughts(spei, vname = "spei12", threshold = -1.28)

}
